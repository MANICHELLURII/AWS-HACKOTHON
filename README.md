## 🎯 Problem Statement

Millions of people consume food daily without accurate knowledge of:

- Calorie intake
- Macronutrient balance
- Portion size accuracy
- Long-term health risks
- Alignment with fitness or medical goals

Manual food logging applications are time-consuming and often inaccurate, particularly for region-specific meals.

NUTRIGEN aims to automate this process using AI.
